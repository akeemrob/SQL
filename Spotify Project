# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I explored the data, examining the coloumns and rows. 
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#I then asked some questions about the data and wrote SQL to get the anwsers from the data. 

-- 1. What is the average danceability by artist
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY danceability DESC;

-- 2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, sum(popularity) 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY sum(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. What artists have the most top 50 songs 
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) as appearance_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY appearance_count DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- 4. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY duration_ms
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- 5. List the top 10 artists in terms of average popularity and label them as Top Star.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS
(
    SELECT  s.artist_name, avg(s.popularity) avg_popularity
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, avg_popularity,  'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE avg_popularity >= 90;
