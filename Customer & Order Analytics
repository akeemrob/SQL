#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

-- 1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT (*) orderID
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6; 

-- 2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT (*) orderID
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND Product = 'iPhone'
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- 4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

-- 5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT  product, 
sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

-- 6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

-- 7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT cust.acctnum) AS Num_of_Customers
, AVG(quantity)*price AS avg_spent, cust.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
